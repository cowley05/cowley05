I am currently a developer at ThoughtWorks and have been since May 2012. I decided I needed a place to write down all of the things ive been learning and experiencing, to both help me remember and share the good things and more importantly share with the world some of the bad things I have seen and done, from both technical aspects and other general crap.

Please share and comment if you like what you see, and if you don't then don't :D
